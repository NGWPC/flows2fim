# CMD Directory

## Overview
The `cmd` directory contains the main application entry points. Each subdirectory here represents a distinct executable or command within the project.

## Guidelines
- **One Executable Per Directory**: Each subdirectory should correspond to an executable and contain a `main.go` file.
- **Naming Conventions**: Name each subdirectory after the command it represents, ensuring clarity and readability.

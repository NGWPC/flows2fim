# PKG Directory

## Overview
The `pkg` directory holds reusable packages that can be used by other applications or within different parts of this project.

## Guidelines
- **Reusable Code**: Place code that provides utility functions, shared logic, or external package wrappers in this directory.
- **General Purpose**: Code in `pkg` should be generic and reusable, not application-specific.
